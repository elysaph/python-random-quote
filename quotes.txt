Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
It's not enough to have talent, you have to be Hungarian
If you want the rainbow, you have to put up with the rain
Make it happen, shock everyone
Sometimes you'll never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory
Stay close to anything that makes you glad you're alive
Slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures in life
The best revenge is massive success
